# Fire-Extinguisher-Bot-using-Arduino

Here i have made an automated fire extinguishing robot using IR Flame sensor and Atmega microcontroller.
I had also modified the IR flame sensor using preset to get analog value as output which increases accuracy of robot when compared to digital.
This robot detects fire,moves towards it automatically and finally extinguishes it using a water pump.
The structure of robot has a base on which everything rests and it has 2 wheels controlled by DC motors.
IN this prjoect i have used the following components:
IR Flame Sensor
Arduino 
DC Motors
L293 Motor drvier for arduino
water pump
Jumpers etc.


Please contact for any clarifications or queries.
